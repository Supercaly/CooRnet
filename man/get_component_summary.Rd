\usage{
get_component_summary(
  output,
  component_threshold = 0.8,
  domains_limit = 5,
  exclude_domains = "google.com, facebook.com, youtube.com",
  domains_history = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{output}{the output list resulting from the function get_coord_shares}

\item{component_threshold}{A value between 0 and 1 used to filter the summary by
their gini.parent_domain}

\item{domains_limit}{Limit the number of domains searched for each component}

\item{exclude_domains}{A comma separated string of domain names to exclude from search}

\item{domains_history}{If set to true returns the history data using the Whois API,
otherwise it returns the raw data}
}
\value{
A list of two data.frame.
        The first is a data frame containing summary data by each coordinated component:
        the average subscribers number of entities in a component,
        the proportion of coordinated shares over the total shares (coorshare_ratio), the average coordinated score (avg_cooRscore),
        a measure of dispersion (gini) in the distribution of domains coordinatedly shared by the component (0-1). Higher values correspond to an higher concentration (less different domains linked),
        the top 5 coordinatedly shared domains (ranked by n. of shares),
        the total number coordinatedly shared of domains.
        The second is a data.frame containing all the domains info with their related components
}
\description{
A function to get summary data by coordinated component
}
\details{
The gini values are computed by using the Gini coefficient on the proportions of unique domains each component shared. The Gini coefficient is a measure of the degree of concentration (inequality) of a variable in a distribution.
It ranges between 0 and 1: the more nearly equal the distribution, the lower its Gini index. When a component shared just one domain, the value of the variable is set to 1. It is calculated separately for full_domains (e.g. www.foxnews.com, video.foxnews.com) and parent domains (foxnews.com)

The cooRscore.avg is a measures of component coordination. Higher values implies higher coordination.
Its value is calculated by dividing, for each entity in a coordinated network, its \code{\link[igraph]{strength}} by its \code{\link[igraph]{degree}}, and then calculating the average by component of these values.

The cooRshare_ratio.avg is an addional measure of component coordination ranging from 0 (no shares coordinated) to 1 (all shares coordinated).

To start using the library you need to set the Whois API key.
  Open the environment variable file with file.edit("~/.Renviron"),
  write WHOIS_API_KEY = <YOUR_API_KEY>, save the file and restart your current R session to start using the Whois API

\examples{
  # get the top ten posts containing URLs shared by each network component and by engagement
  component_summary <- get_component_summary(output)

  # clustering the components rowwise mutate
  clusters <- hclust(dist(component_summary[, 2:4]))
  plot(clusters)
